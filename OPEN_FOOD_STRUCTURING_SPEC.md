OPEN FOOD STRUCTURING SPECIFICATION

Version 1.0 | November 2025 | Public Domain

Executive Summary

This document establishes open, non-proprietary methods for creating meat-like textures and food structures, specifically designed to bypass corporate patent claims on mycelial scaffolding and proprietary structuring technologies. It provides patent-free pathways using physical, chemical, and biological approaches that are faster and more versatile than proprietary alternatives.

1. Core Structuring Technologies

· Temperature Range: 20-140°C (with precise control)
· Capacity: 500g to 50kg batches (scalable design)
· Power: 0.5-5 kW (depending on scale)

Process Parameters:

```
Protein Concentration: 15-30% (w/w)
Shear Duration: 5-30 minutes
Temperature Profile: 30°C → 90°C → 30°C
Pressure: Ambient (no high-pressure equipment needed)
Cooling Rate: Controlled 2-5°C/minute
```

1.2 Directed Protein Aggregation

Principle: Using specific ions, pH shifts, and thermal cycles to induce fibrous gel formation.

Standardized Protocol:

· Base Protein: Pea, soy, or fungal protein (15-25% concentration)
· Ion Induction: Calcium chloride (0.1-0.5M) or magnesium sulfate
