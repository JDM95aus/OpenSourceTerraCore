PRIOR ART DISCLOSURE: Integrated Atmospheric Water Generation & Purification System

Disclosure Date: November 10, 2025

Inventor: Joshua Roy Dakin Mandryk

Prior Art For: All integrated solar-powered atmospheric water generation systems with cross-platform resource exchange

Core Innovation Claim

This disclosure establishes prior art for systems that:

1. Generate potable water from atmospheric humidity using hybrid thermoelectric-cooling adsorption cycles
2. Integrate multi-stage purification (mechanical, UV-C, ozone, remineralization) in a single mobile unit
3. Operate primarily on solar power with intelligent power management for variable-speed operation
4. Exchange resources with allied systems including:
   · Waste humidity to climate control for food production systems
   · Reject heat to pre-heat thermal conversion systems
   · Pure water for cooling/humidification of integrated systems
   · Biomass from food systems for filtration media regeneration

Technical Principles

· Use of Peltier cooler arrays staged for maximum temperature differential
· Graphene-coated copper condensation plates for rapid water shedding
· Multi-stage purification: mechanical → UV-C → ozone → remineralization
· Humidity prediction using environmental data for operational optimization
· Modular quick-connect interfaces for fluid/gas exchange between systems

System Integration Claim

This prior art specifically covers the synergistic combination of:
[Solar Power]→ [Atmospheric Water Generation] → [Multi-Stage Purification] → [Potable Water]
↓
[Waste Humidity]→ [Food Production Climate Control]
[Reject Heat] → [Thermal Conversion System Pre-heating]
[Biomass from Food Systems] → [Filtration Media Regeneration]

Performance Characteristics

· Production Range: 20-50 liters per day from ambient air
· Operational Range: 30-90% relative humidity, 15-40°C ambient
· Power Profile: 300-480W during generation cycles
· Water Quality: Meets WHO standards with essential mineral retention

Legal Notice

This public disclosure establishes prior art invalidating any patent claims filed after this date covering integrated atmospheric water generation systems with cross-platform resource exchange and solar-powered operation.

Note: Full technical specifications, manufacturing blueprints, and build instructions for the Terracore Mk3 "AquaCore" system are available upon inquiry and are part of the integrated Terracore platform.
